# Moonray gui v2

moonray_gui_v2 is an imgui-based application (glfw/opengl3) that replaces the existing QT
application. It currently builds on both linux and mac.

## Getting Started

After cloning this project, you must run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in order to initialize and update 
the imgui submodule. 

To run, simply use `moonray_gui_v2` instead of `moonray_gui`.

## Usage
While future UI improvements are forthcoming, moonray_gui_v2 currently relies on hotkeys for user 
interaction. It mostly uses the same hotkeys as moonray_gui v1, but a few have been 
changed. Use hotkey `H` to print all the hotkeys to the console.
Here are the hotkey mappings (the changed hotkeys have stars next to them):

## Configuration Files

moonray_gui_v2 stores user configuration and state files in a dedicated config directory to keep the project folder clean:

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/moonray_gui/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/moonray_gui/`

The following files are stored there:
- `imgui.ini` - ImGui window layout and positions
- (Future: keybindings)

The config directory is created automatically on first run. If creation fails, settings will not persist between sessions.
